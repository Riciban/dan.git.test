                            <span class="first-letter">A</p>lmost every year, there is that one video game that dominates public conversation. 2016 saw millions stroll outside on a quest to Catch ‘em All in <i>Pokémon GO</i>. Last year saw the (still) shoddily put together <i>PlayerUnknown’s Battle Grounds</i> riff off a beloved Cult Favourite Japanese film <i>Battle Royale</i>. This year will be the year of <i>Fortnite</i>, and more than any of the other examples, this one broke all kinds of minds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Fortnite</i> officially released in 2014 as the new kid trying to hit that crowded “Survival Crafting” genre. After escaping vaporware status, the game came to a trepid response and fell into the abyss of <i>DayZ</i> clones. Then after <i>PlayerUnknown’s Battle Grounds</i> blazed the way with a new type of competitive game, developer Epic Games decided to try their own version. Instead of a whole new game, the developer decided to add the mode to to <i> Fortnite </i> in late 2017. Now, Fortnite has started a phenomenon that has exploded across pop culture. It was not only a game that became popular to play, but in many cases, far more popular to watch.

                        <p>
                            The residual effect of <i>Fortnite</i>, is that is has brought a whole new audience to streaming platforms, especially Twitch. Twitch has been the premiere streaming platform for years, but <i>Fortnite</i> brought it the biggest views it had ever seen. So by looking at the Twitch data provided by <a href= https://sullygnome.com/ target="_blank"> SullyGnome </a>, we can understand just how Fortnite dwarfed almost anything else on the platform.

                          <i>Fortnite</i> is a behemoth of a game and has dwarfed the competition at unseen levels. The chart above shows the top five games in both hours watched and stream time. While <i>Fortnite</i> has a steady lead in terms of how many hours people were watching, the real standout comes from just how many people were streaming Fortnite. Compared to <i>League of Legends</i>, the number of hours streamed is almost quadruple.

                          Publisher and developer Epic games are the second highest streamed publisher in terms of watch time where Activision Blizzard holds the top spot. What makes this so alarming is that while Activision Blizzard takes the position with a spread over 10 different games, as opposed to Epic sitting with just <i>Fortnite</i> in first place.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Activision Blizzard’s 10 game split comes down to popularity. Their competitive card game <i>Hearthstone</i> sits with the biggest share which is followed by <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>World of Warcraft</i>. <i>Black Ops IIII</i> with its own Battle Royale mode will likely make big waves in the coming year and may trounce the established Activision Blizzard games.

                          So, this is a case where <i>Fortnite</i> doesn’t quite take the top crown in terms of peak views, but that is only because the top spot belongs to the annual Electronic Gaming Expo. <i>Fortnite</i> does hold it for the game beating out the regular top performers who gain their sports due to either big eSports events or high-profile launches.

                          Understanding the genre breakdowns can also add some insight into just how much of a juggernaut <i>Fortnite</i> is. Looking at the genres, there is a harsh divide between those that dominate the amount of viewer time, and those that proliferate the genre.

                          Survival Crafting games have been considered streaming fodder for years, but Battle Royale genre dwarfs the list. For the genre with one of the smaller counts of games, it leads the pack as opposed to Survival Crafting taking the most space yet the least attention.

                        <p>
                          What adds to the novelty of this data is that <i>Fortnite</i> was originally part of the oversaturated genre and never made near the waves it does now. Examining the stark difference between the two can show how the battle royale genre might end up after some time.
                        </p>

                          For now, there are only a three games that distinctly fit the Battle Royale games that took to the top 100. <i>Realm Royale</i> is the only oddity of the bunch being ranked at 45 with a much smaller number of views as compared to the heavy hitters of <i>PUBG</i> and <i>Fortnite</i>. Fortnite has two thirds of the battle royale share. It is worth noting that for this retrospective, <i>Black Ops IIII</i> has not been included within the battle royale genre despite “Blackout” being based on the popular genre. As more games start to include the mode in coming years, looking at genre breakdowns will be very different.

                          <i>Fortnite</i> is the darling of 2018 and will likely be a key point of deliberations with the coming game of the year discussions. As for Twitch, it has embraced the new wave of views and continues to build upon the growing community of streamers and viewers. It is very hard to read where <i>Fortnite</i> goes in 2019, considering the waves can shift very quickly, but its impact will long be felt on streaming platforms.
