        The back-to-back killings in Rogers Park seemed to be as random as they were brutal: an elderly man walking his dogs just steps from his home on Sunday and then, barely 36 hours later, a young man walking blocks away on the Lakefront Trail near Loyola Park. Both were shot once in the head, left for dead.

          People gather Oct. 2, 2018, to remember Eliyahu Moscowitz and Douglass Watts after they were both shot and killed in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood.

        But police on Tuesday confirmed what for many residents was their worst fear: The same gun was used to shoot both men, most likely by the same gunman. Just about every other detail remains a mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is clear is that the killings of Douglass Watts, 73, and Eliyahu Moscowitz, 24, have shaken the neighborhood known for its diversity, prompting Mayor Rahm Emanuel to urge residents to use caution as they go about their daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        “To all the residents of the Rogers Park community, your city is standing with you, supporting you, at this moment,” Emanuel said at a news conference. "I know firsthand the Rogers Park community is strong, is resilient and is a supportive community. We need those core values and the Police Department needs those core values at this time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Chicago police said Watts and Moscowitz did not appear to know each other. Police have not found a motive behind the attacks. Nothing was taken from the victims during the shootings.

        “Given the frequency of these homicides and what we know about the investigations, detectives have been working aggressively to cultivate leads," police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asked whether police were investigating the shootings as a possible hate crime because Watts was gay and Moscowitz an observant Jew, Johnson said it was too early to rule anything out.
      </p>
      <p>
        A surveillance video of the suspect in the first attack showed a man wearing black pants and a black jacket with a hat and scarf pulled over most of his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        As news spread about the shootings, residents of Rogers Park organized vigils, community events and even the start of a new block club.

        In other attempts to create safety in numbers, some Rogers Park residents are organizing groups to walk dogs together.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help residents feel safe, police will be increasing patrols, saturating the lakefront and surrounding areas in Rogers Park with officers, including those on bicycle patrol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loyola campus police also issued an alert to students and faculty warning “the offender in these murder investigations is an ongoing threat to the campus area,” even though the attacks did not happen within the school’s boundaries.

        At the gathering, residents passed out flyers depicting a shooting suspect as Chicago police officers walked through the park.

        Long considered one of Chicago’s most diverse neighborhoods, Rogers Park is a popular destination for new immigrants from Africa, central Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the world. It's also home to Loyola University Chicago.
      </p>
      <p>
        The neighborhood is far from Chicago's most violent communities, though the Rogers Park police district — which covers the community itself as well as neighboring West Rogers Park and a part of Edgewater — has seen a slight jump in homicides over the last year.

        Typically, much of the violence in Rogers Park stems from protracted gang feuds that erupt, many of them occurring within several blocks of the CTA Red Line station at Howard Street and along blocks that surround the Red Line stop at Morse Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both men, though, were shot in the eastern part of the neighborhood. Watts was killed in the 1400 block of West Sherwin Avenue, and Moscowitz was slain south of Loyola Park on the 1100 block of West Lunt Avenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ald. Joe Moore, 49th, who lives about a block and a half from where Watts was killed, said he could see why people are on edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Obviously people are very concerned, understandably, and frightened,” Moore said. “This is not something that is a common everyday occurrence in our neighborhood.”
      </p>
      <p>
        At Tuesday’s news conference, Emanuel expressed condolences to the victims, though he hadn’t been able to reach both families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moscowitz, who supervised a kosher kitchen at a Jewel-Osco store, was fatally shot on the evening of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that celebrates reading the final chapter of the Torah before restarting the scroll. His family would not use technology during the holiday, so Emanuel said it wasn’t appropriate to call them yet.
